## Fresh installation

Debian being Debian, it comes with a really bare installation.
When you first install a Debian 6 server, it lacks a few things to get serverplop started.

- sudo
- zip / git

When you want to set up your server for the first time, please install the following as root:

```bash
$ apt-get install -y sudo zip
```

Or, alternatively you can directly go for the forking method, using:

```bash
$ apt-get install -y sudo git
```

Then you either [download the ZIP archive](https://github.com/johmanx10/serverplop/archive/master.zip) and extract that, or you clone the git repo.

## Development

To simply build a fresh development environment, do the following:

```bash
$ make development
```

Development is a bundle make rule for the following make rules:

- lamp
- locales
- xdebug
- phpunit
- codesniffer (defaults to PSR2 if possible)
- nodejs (which calls `make java8`)
- square

Additionally, there are some specific developer subsets.

$ make php-developer
```
